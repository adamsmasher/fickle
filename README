fickle - a function pickler
---------------------------

python's built in pickle module can't pickle any non-top-level functions.
fickle aims to rectify this - with fickle you can pickle local functions,
lambda, closures, etc.



Known Issues
------------

- mutual recursive functions don't work, and may be impossible to reconstruct
  in pure python
- functions sharing mutable closed over data do not work correctly
